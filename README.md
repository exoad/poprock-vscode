## Installing

### Marketplace

Simply search for `poprock theme` or head over to my publisher page [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/exoad)

### Via VSIX file

`vsix` files are used to package VSCode plugins and extensions. If you wish to install via this method, you can find VSIX files in a plethora of areas on this repository.

1. Via the [releases tab](https://github.com/exoad/poprock-vscode/releases) and click on the `latest-release` or a select version that you want and download the attached VSIX file
2. Download the artifact produced by the VSIX workflow which can be found [here](https://github.com/exoad/poprock-vscode/actions/workflows/build_vsix.yml)

### Overrding `settings.json`

> [!WARNING]
> I do not recommend using this method to install the theme

If you do not wish to go through the Microsft VSCode Marketplace, you can simply inject the properties found in [`repo/settings.json`](./repo/settings.json) into your own `settings.json`.
